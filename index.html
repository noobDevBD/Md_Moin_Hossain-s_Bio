With a population of over 23 million, Dhaka is facing significant transportation challenges and the proposed metro system is seen as a way to provide fast, reliable, and efficient transportation services to commuters.<br> The proposed network will consist of multiple lines and serve a large part of the city, including the city center, airports, and universities. The construction of the metro rail is expected to help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and support the cityâ€™s economic growth. While the exact details of the project, such as the route, number of stations, and completion date, are yet to be determined, the government and transportation authorities are working to make the Dhaka Metro Rail a reality to help improve the quality of life for the residents of Dhaka.
